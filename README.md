🧠 Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV & Tkinter
A simple yet powerful real-time face detection application built with Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter.
This project uses OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier to detect human faces in live webcam feed and displays them with bounding boxes in a clean graphical interface.

🚀 Features
🎥 Live Face Detection — Detect faces in real-time using your webcam.
🧩 Interactive GUI — Start, Stop, and Exit buttons for easy control.
🔢 Face Counter — Displays how many faces are detected on screen.
⚙️ Built with Python — Lightweight and works on any system with a webcam.

🧠 How It Works
The app loads OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar Cascade model for frontal face detection.
Each frame from your webcam is processed in real-time.
Detected faces are highlighted and displayed in a Tkinter window.
Tkinter’s event loop keeps the feed live and responsive.

🛠️ Future Improvements
Add a snapshot feature to save detected faces.
Integrate deep learning models (e.g., Mediapipe, Dlib) for improved accuracy.
Upgrade to CustomTkinter for a modern, glass-like UI design.
